Slides for the Intro to Data Science course.
This folder is just the release 3.8.0 of reveal.js, with the only change that the original `README.md` is moved to `original_README.md` and of course the `index.html` contains the actual content.

Run `make showslides` on the repo root folder to start the presentation.
