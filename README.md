## About me
Slides for this section can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTbd4eONN5nSiNaTWW3uM2RM3O0jsoVT8gQ9byqa0X5vStBZGUBfiUSM7-HegCjymaDbaUzQ-9yyvMR/pub).

## The Python Programming Language
Complete slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRPV8i3pQw7MCa6eG-9y9LgIFREJF_3sN4opFDXQ2r_NJgea9ObLJQfj4S_CiM6Ptxs7t0WU6lCa-QH/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000), inclusive of exercises

Extra links:
 * [The SciPy Lectures -- The Python Language](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/language/python_language.html).

Practice those examples using alternatively python files, the IPython interpreter and an IPython Notebook.

To practice:
* [Python interactive exercises](http://codingbat.com/python)
* [Join the codewars competitions](http://www.codewars.com/?language=python)

### Python 2 vs. Python 3

Note: as explained in the lesson you should now just go with Python 3. These links are from more than 2 years ago but still useful if you need to use old libraries.

A great [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb) covering the main differences has been written by Sebastian Raschka.

To keep your code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you might also want to use [this Cheat Sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#cheat-sheet-writing-python-2-3-compatible-code).

### Installing Python and all useful packages
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/10)

### Tools for writing Python Code (from Kristian)

#### Python shell
The most basic interactive Python command line, where each line starts with a `>>>`.

#### IDLE
Standard editor in Python distributions, easy to use but very basic.

#### IPython
A more sophisticated interactive Python command line. It incorporates tab-completion, interactive help and regular shell commands. Also look up the `%`-magic commands.

#### Spyder
**Spyder** is part of the **Anaconda** Python distribution. It is a small IDE mostly for data analysis, similar to RStudio. It automatically highlights Syntax errors, contains a variable explorer, debugging functionality and other useful things.

#### Jupyter Notebooks
Interactive environment for the web browser. A Jupyter notebook contains Python code, text, images and any output from your program (including plots!). It is a great tool for exploratory data analysis.

#### Sublime2
A general-purpose text editor that works on all systems. There are many plugins for Python available. There are a free and a commercial version available.

#### Visual Studio Code
The Open Source cousin of Sublime2, similar to Atom.

#### PyCharm
PyCharm is probably the most luxurious IDE for Python. It contains tons of functions that are a superset of all the above. PyCharm is a great choice for bigger Python projects. Free for non-commercial use.

#### Vim
I know people who are successfully using Vim to write Python code and are happy with it.

#### Emacs
I know people who are successfully using Emacs to write Python code, but haven't asked them how happy they are.

### Running the IPython interpreter and a python file
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/12)

### Jupyter Notebook
A live demo will be given during the masterclass. Here just a [warning note](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2ntOr6vWHgHoC0X3arDtim9fIhaoF7r6Vl5fVjxSXeXpD2NRykOSR_UyQzbtjppD2tiqwkw2peMfQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

Experiment further with the IPython Notebook environment with [this Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb).
Try to clone or download it, before opening it, running and modifying its cells.

Many more Jupyter features in [this blog post](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/09/10/jupyter-features.html).

And of course, be aware of the fact Jupyter is NOT an IDE and can bite you in various ways: [See this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit#slide=id.g3cb1319227_1_388)

## Git
Slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSRDWRpbJpNmtPk5SufekG8bSbBSJGjsua-nf-BxTzS_F2qMkHwmFPzjQlnR6op2pwa0QzL-PTFGikx/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

## What is machine learning
A brief introduction/recap of ML its terminology. Slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRfxH8TbgtOQy24JBu28i12kYrbUquXKu6VZhZC3wyCUdiLW1HqF75mgnLI-EjKHFQUdPeZ-6OYD8G7/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

## NumPy and Matplotlib

### NumPy
Start with the official [NumPy Tutorial](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial). Note: if this link returns an error, move to the [PDF version](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~barry/mydocs/MyCOMP28512/MS15_Notes/PyRefs/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial.pdf).

Move on to these [exercises](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/numpy/exercises.html).

### Matplotlib
Learn the basics and some more advanced plotting tricks in Matplotlib with this [hands-on tutorial](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html).

It's also very useful to look at the [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) to find examples of every possible chart you may want.

## Scikit-learn and your first ML case

Slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTjCOfNagJZzOjovAPgNBkVxcddNlKbWZ5oxEjicbuFyEwpAbMjG8m7x0tx3xjqUyKkoYFh0rysWRNL/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
### Scikit-learn

## SciPy
SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python.
[Here](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/scipy.html) is a hands-on overview of this collection, together with practical exercises and more advanced problems.

For those willing to go further on the statistical aspects of SciPy, I recommend having a look at these IPython Notebooks on [Effect Size](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/effect_size.ipynb), [Random Sampling](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/sampling.ipynb) and [Hypothesis Testing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/hypothesis.ipynb).
